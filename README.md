## Improvement points
- Cover 100% of the application of unit tests
- Better distribute global variables and methods to components, currently all components receive what they need directly from page.tsx
- Remove more code from components and put it in hooks
- Reuse more code that has been created in duplicate
- Create a global theme and variants to contain colors, fonts, spacing, etc.
- Delete everything from global.css that I forgot and coded with it
